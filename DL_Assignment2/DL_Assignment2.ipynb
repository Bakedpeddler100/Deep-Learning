        "On April 15th, 2020, UNICEF issued a warning in response to the increased risk of cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic due to widespread school closures, increased screen time, and decreased face-to-face social interaction. The statistics of cyberbullying are outright alarming: 36.5% of middle and high school students have felt cyberbullied and 87% have observed cyberbullying, with effects ranging from decreased academic performance to depression to suicidal thoughts.\n",

The resulting embedding captures whether words appear in similar contexts or not whereas in Approach 2 we've used LSTM model which enables us to input sequence data into a network, and make predictions based on the individual time steps of the sequence data.\n",
