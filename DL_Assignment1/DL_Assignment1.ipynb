        "Discovery of surface breaks is a significant errand in checking the underlying wellbeing of substantial designs. Assuming that breaks create and proceed to propogate, they diminish the successful burden bearing surface region and can over the long haul cause disappointment of the design. More dense layers are not added in the CNN approach, in order to avoid the \"overfitting\" case.\n",
